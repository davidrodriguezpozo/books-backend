# books-backend

Backend for the webpage of the repository *frontend-vue*

It serves several APIs regarding the import and export of books

To start the server:
```
npm  install  --legacy-peer-deps
npm  start
```
Please bear in mind that the  --legacy-peer-deps modifier is only needed in some versions of Node (newer). If running npm install gives 'dependencies tree conflict', run it with --legacy-peer-deps.
